# Hertfordshire Noise Predictive Analysis

## Overview
This project addresses the challenge of noise pollution in Hertfordshire, a growing urban area where noise significantly impacts public health and quality of life. Using geospatial and traffic datasets, this analysis aims to visualize, analyze, and predict noise pollution levels. The results support policymakers in making informed decisions to mitigate urban noise.

## Objectives
- Analyze and visualize noise pollution data.
- Identify the factors influencing noise levels.
- Build a predictive model to estimate noise pollution.
- Provide actionable insights for urban planning.

## Key Features
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Retrieved traffic data using the Google Maps API.
   - Collected geospatial noise data and environmental variables.
2. **Data Cleaning and Integration**:
   - Combined traffic, noise, and building datasets using geospatial tools.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Visualized noise pollution patterns using heatmaps and scatterplots.
4. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Developed a Random Forest model to estimate noise levels.
   - Analyzed feature importance to understand key drivers of noise pollution.
5. **Results and Insights**:
   - Identified critical factors influencing noise pollution.
   - Provided data-driven insights for urban noise mitigation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas` and `geopandas` for data manipulation and geospatial analysis.
  - `matplotlib` and `folium` for visualization.
  - `scikit-learn` for predictive modeling.
- **APIs**:
  - Google Maps API for traffic data collection.
- **Machine Learning**:
  - Random Forest Regressor for noise level prediction.

## Results
- **Feature Importance**:
  - Proximity to roads and vehicle count are the most significant contributors to noise pollution.
- **Model Accuracy**:
  - The Random Forest model demonstrated meaningful accuracy in predicting noise levels.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Heatmaps highlighted noise pollution hotspots.
  - Scatterplots and bar charts revealed relationships between noise levels and environmental features.
